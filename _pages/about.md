Hi, I'm Shaofei Li. I'm currently a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by Prof. [Ding Li](https://marapapman.github.io/), Prof. [Yao Guo](https://yaoguopku.github.io/) and Prof. [Xiangqun Chen](https://dblp.org/pid/49/628.html). I earned my B.S. degree from the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at Peking University in 2021. I'm now a visiting PhD student at the School of Computer in National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. [Zhenkai Liang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~liangzk/).

My research interests include cybersecurity, system security and AI security. My research focuses on developing detection and defense mechanisms for various security threats in the real world systems. I have published several papers in top-tier security conferences and transactions such as S&P, NDSS, CCS and TOSEM. 

In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball, badminton and cycling. I'm a member of the men’s basketball teams and badmiton teams for the CS departments at Peking University. And I have been a member of the [Cycling Association of Peking University(CAPU)](https://chexie.net/#main) since 2018. I participated in the summer expedition practice group's long-distance cycling of more than 2,000km from Jiayuguan to Chengdu [[video]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV14b411N79B/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=51525784685e693bb27951657c05023d).
